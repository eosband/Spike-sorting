# spike-sorting

## About
Project created over a semester for the class INT540: Computational Neuroscience at Phillips Academy Andover. 

Spike sorting is the process whereby raw electrode data is transformed into individual neuron firing patterns. We learned the theory of how this process worked in the class, but I took it upon myself to attempt the process individually as a project. 
Using the Machine Learningtechniques of bandpass filtering, principal components analysis, and k-means clustering, I successfuly completed the task on one such dataset.
